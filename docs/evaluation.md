# Evaluation

Evaluation is built around the internal schema so public dataset adapters can normalize labels before
metrics are computed.

## Implemented Metrics

- Exact span/type precision, recall, and F1.
- Relaxed overlap span/type precision, recall, and F1.
- Linking accuracy at 1, recall at 5/10/20, and MRR.
- Assertion/context accuracy.
- Typed relation precision, recall, and F1.
- Error-analysis CSV with document id, error type, text window, gold label, prediction, candidate
  list, and notes.

## Recommended Gates

- Run validator checks before evaluation.
- Track candidate recall at 20 before adding rerankers.
- Treat offset regressions as blocking.
- Compare context-specific errors for negation, family history, historical mentions, and possible
  findings.
